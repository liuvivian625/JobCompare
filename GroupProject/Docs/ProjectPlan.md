## 1 Introduction

*Here you introduce the product. Keep this clean and simple, one or two sentences at most.*

JobCompare is an android application that allows users to compare various details of job offers to help them choose the best offer for themselves.

## 2 Process Description

*Project development process description as a set of activities; for each development process activity, provide the following:*

- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*


### Inception
- The activity description for the inception phase would be to understand the project requirements. This means read the instructions and understand all the features of the application. This phase also includes evaluating project scopes where we understand what features/activities are in the project scope such as being able to add job offers. One item that is not in scope is deleting jobs because the project requirement documents did not specify. However that is a feature that can be added in the future if time allows. In this phase we will also create initial documents such as Class, UML, User Interface Diagram, Deployment and Component diagrams. After creating documents, the team will get together and review documents, discuss and make changes if needed. Finally this activity includes also making a project plan where we discussed what we expect to do for each phase and how the work can be accomplished by assigning work/roles.
- The entrance criteria for this activity is the initial project requirements.
- The exit criteria is creating initial documents, understanding app features, understanding the scope of the app, and understanding the phases of the software development life cycle.

### Elaboration
- The elaboration phase consists of elaborating on the use case model diagram to address the most critical use cases. It also includes  elaborating a testing plan to test app functionality. Finally it includes elaborating on a design document to describe design considerations, architectural design, low-level design, and user interface design.
- The entrance criteria for this activity is having initial documents ready, understanding the scope of the application, and understanding features/determining features.
- The exit criteria for this activity is to elaborate on all the documents and make sure the vision and architecture are stable. The documents and plan need to be detailed. We also need to make sure that all stakeholders and team members are in agreement. All team members and stakeholders need to be aware of requirements, features, and the phases of which the application will be built.

### Construction
- The construction phase consists of a complete set of design, code and test cases. Code complete is achieved by completing all user stories, requirements and features. It also includes developing tests and testing the application which is achieved developing and thoroughly testing all features through various tests like integration, systems, and unit tests. It also includes finalizes documents for testing, design and user guides. Since this phase may be the longest, it can be split into muliple phases such as initial requirements and final application readiness. The exit and entrance criteria for both phases is different and as a team we have decided that we should have different requirements for each.
- The initial requirements entrance criteria is having initial documents and a plan ready, thereby the team need to finalize the documents and begin coding in the next phase.
- The initial exit requirements are to have basic features ready such as adding a new job and displaying all jobs ranked by score. The initial exit requirements also include finishing all documents including a project plan, design document, class diagrams, and any other diagrams. It also includes creating an initial set of tests that test the initial requirements that the team members have agreed upon.
- 
- The final entrance criteria is to have all documents already finished and initial requirement features and tests completed.
- The final exit criteria is to finish all features, address all uses cases/requirements, have a full passing set of tests (integration, systems, unit tests), and be ready for deployment or submission of the application.

### Transition
- The transition phase consists of releasing the application, collecting bug reports and feature requests. If also includes releasing a new version if it is needed.
- The entrance criteria is a finished application with all the necessary documents.
- The exit criteria is the project/application is complete and is in use.

## 3 Team

*Describe the team and their roles (include at least 4 roles, there may be more roles than there are team members)*

- *Team members' names*

- *Roles, with a short description of each role*
- Backend: Create backend code that involves comparison methods, actions when buttons are clicked. Create APIs that the frontend code uses to process inputs,
- Frontend: Create GUI and buttons. Make sure all features of the frontend that the user will use are created and working.
- Database: Create DB table, schema, and queries. Create APIs that will then interact with the backend code that is then called by the frontend code.
- Testing: Create a testing plan which includes testing all parts of the application. This role will include creating unit, integration, and systems tests that test all features and parts of the application including frontend, backend and database layers.
- Documents: This role involves creating documents. There are 5 documents to create: Project Plan, Use Case Model, Design Document, and Test plan.

- *Table showing which team member(s) has which role(s)*

*Everyone will end up doing a little bit of everything*

- Timesh Patel: Environment/system (include database) setup, frontend, testing, documents.
- Jing Liu: Frontend, backend, testing, documents.
- Haochen Zhang: Frontend, backend, testing, documents.
- Vineet Baburaj: Frontend, backend, testing, documents.

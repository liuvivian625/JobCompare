My accomplishments for this deliverable:

I created a new branch and the initial directory structure. I've also added my documents to my own directory as well.
I led the first meeting where we introduced ourselves and talked about our UML diagrams. I also took notes and added them to the design-discussion.md file.
In our second meeting, I helped to create the final UML diagram and contributed parts of my individual design to the final design. I also finished the editing the design-discussion.md file.
